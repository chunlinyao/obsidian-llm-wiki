 * Tests for Issue #75: token budget constants.
 *
 * These constants cap LLM output sizes per call type. Two changes:
 * - TOKENS_DEDUP_RESOLUTION: 300 → 1000 (insurance against thinking-model preamble)
 * - TOKENS_QUERY_SAVE_DEDUP: 150 → 300 (similar insurance)
 *
 * The other values are unchanged but explicitly asserted to document intent.
